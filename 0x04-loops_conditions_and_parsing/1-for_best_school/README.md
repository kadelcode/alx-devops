Write a Bash script that displays ```Best School``` 10 times.
Requirement:
- You must use the ```for``` loop (```while``` and ```until``` are forbidden)
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ head -n 2 1-for_best_school 
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script is displaying "Best School" 10 times
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-for_best_school 
Best School
Best School
Best School
Best School
Best School
Best School
Best School
Best School
Best School
Best School
sylvain@ubuntu$
``` 
Note that:
- The first line of my Bash script starts with ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
- The second line of my Bash scripts is a comment explaining what it is doing
