Write a script that converts a number from base 2 to base 10
- The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable ```BINARY```
- The script should display the number in base 10, followed by a new line.
```
julien@production-503e7013:~/$ export BINARY=10100111001
julien@production-503e7013:~/$ ./11-binary_to_decimal
