Let’s practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file. Just as in the previous configuration file task, we’d like you to set up your client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.

Requirements:

- Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
- Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
Example:

```
vagrant@ubuntu:~$ sudo puppet apply 100-puppet_ssh_config.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for ubuntu-xenial in environment production in 0.11 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/File_line[Turn off passwd auth]/ensure: created
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/File_line[Declare identity file]/ensure: created
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.03 seconds
vagrant@ubuntu:~$
```
